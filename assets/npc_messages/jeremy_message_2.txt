Jeremy Jr: “My dad was never a fan of you mayors and I can’t help but agree. They seem to give anyone the job who wants it these days. Unfortunately for me, I have no choice but to appeal to what I hope is your ability to help. That goshdarn bridge of mine is going to blow over any minute. You’ve come to help, I take it?”
You: “Er - I’m happy to hear you out.”
Jeremy Jr: “I guess that’s as good as I’ll get.”

OPTION: Invest $70,000 in the bridge, which will earn a return of $2000/yr for the town.
