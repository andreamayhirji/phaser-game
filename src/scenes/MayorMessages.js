level1: `Congrats on your win at the polls, Mayor! Now that you’re mayor, it’s time to fulfill on your mandate: to create jobs for Bajo Island.

In order to fulfill on your election promise, you must find those on Bajo who have vested interests in your platform. Gather their advice and when you are ready, return to Townhall where you will make your decision.

Speaking as the previous mayor, let me give you one valuable piece of advice: choose carefully, because the decisions you make for Bajo will have far reaching consequences…`,

level2: `Congratulations Mayor Jr. I am so proud of you for continuing our family legacy as Bajo’s newly elected mayor!

You’ve won on a platform to strengthen infrastructure on the island. Let the citizens of Bajo guide your decision making. When you’re ready, I’ll be in the Townhall waiting to hear what you’ve decided.

Remember what I told you when you were young: your decisions will impact future generations of Bajoians, so choose wisely…`,

level3: `Oh, Mayor the III. Times are a-changin’! It's time for me to pass the reins over to you, to lead the next generation of islanders.

You’ve won the election with the mandate to combat overcrowding on Bajo. It's a tough one, but I see that you're up to the task. When you’re ready to make a decision, return here to Townhall.

I don’t envy you the task that’s ahead. I always told you to under promise and over deliver but alas, you've chosen the difficult path towards re-election... Good luck, my padawan!`
